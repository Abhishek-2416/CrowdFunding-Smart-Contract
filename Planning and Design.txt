    1. The Admin will start a campaign for CrowdFunding with a specific monetary goal and deadline

    2. Contributors will contribute to the project by sending ethereum

    3. The admin has to create a spending request to spend money for the campaign

    4. If more than 50% of the total Contributors voted for the request then the admin would have the permission to spend the amount specified in the spending request

    5. The main benefit of a CrowdFunding Dapp over regular CrowdFunding is here the power is moved into the hands of the people who donated money than just the admin

    6. The Contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the deadline
